We shall define a _pythagorean polygon_ to be a **convex polygon** with the
following properties:  

  * there are at least three vertices,
  * no three vertices are aligned,
  * each vertex has **integer coordinates**,
  * each edge has **integer length**.

For a given integer n, define P(n) as the number of distinct pythagorean
polygons for which the perimeter is ≤ n.  
Pythagorean polygons should be considered distinct as long as none is a
translation of another.

You are given that P(4) = 1, P(30) = 3655 and P(60) = 891045.  
Find P(120).
