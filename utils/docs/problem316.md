Let p = p1 p2 p3 ... be an infinite sequence of random digits, selected from
{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} with equal probability.  
It can be seen that p corresponds to the real number 0.p1 p2 p3 ....  
It can also be seen that choosing a random real number from the interval [0,1)
is equivalent to choosing an infinite sequence of random digits selected from
{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} with equal probability.

For any positive integer n with d decimal digits, let k be the smallest index
such that  
pk, pk+1, ...pk+d-1 are the decimal digits of n, in the same order.  
Also, let g(n) be the expected value of k; it can be proven that g(n) is
always finite and, interestingly, always an integer number.

For example, if n = 535, then  
for p = 31415926**535**897...., we get k = 9  
for p = 35528714365004956000049084876408468**535**4..., we get k = 36  
etc and we find that g(535) = 1008.
