A definition for an ellipse is:  
Given a circle c with centre M and radius r and a point G such that
d(G,M)&lt;r, the locus of the points that are equidistant from c and G form an
ellipse.

The construction of the points of the ellipse is shown below.

Given are the points M(-2000,1500) and G(8000,1500).  
Given is also the circle c with centre M and radius 15000.  
The locus of the points that are equidistant from G and c form an ellipse e.  
From a point P outside e the two tangents t1 and t2 to the ellipse are drawn.  
Let the points where t1 and t2 touch the ellipse be R and S.

For how many lattice points P is angle RPS greater than 45 degrees?
