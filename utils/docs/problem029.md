Consider all integer combinations of _a__b_ for 2 ≤ _a_ ≤ 5 and 2 ≤ _b_ ≤ 5:

> 22=4, 23=8, 24=16, 25=32  
>  32=9, 33=27, 34=81, 35=243  
>  42=16, 43=64, 44=256, 45=1024  
>  52=25, 53=125, 54=625, 55=3125  
>

If they are then placed in numerical order, with any repeats removed, we get
the following sequence of 15 distinct terms:

4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 64, 81, 125, 243, 256, 625, 1024, 3125

How many distinct terms are in the sequence generated by _a__b_ for 2 ≤ _a_ ≤
100 and 2 ≤ _b_ ≤ 100?
