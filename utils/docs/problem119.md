Difficulty rating: 30%

The number 512 is interesting because it is equal to the sum of its digits
raised to some power: 5 + 1 + 2 = 8, and 83 = 512. Another example of a number
with this property is 614656 = 284.

We shall define _a_n to be the _n_th term of this sequence and insist that a
number must contain at least two digits to have a sum.

You are given that _a_2 = 512 and _a_10 = 614656.

Find _a_30.
