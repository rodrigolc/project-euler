Consider a honey bee's honeycomb where each cell is a perfect regular hexagon
with side length 1.

One particular cell is occupied by the queen bee.  
For a positive real number L, let B(L) count the cells with distance L from
the queen bee cell (all distances are measured from centre to centre); you may
assume that the honeycomb is large enough to accommodate for any distance we
wish to consider.  
For example, B(√3) = 6, B(√21) = 12 and B(111 111 111) = 54.

Find the number of L ≤ 5·1011 such that B(L) = 450.
