The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

> F_n_ = F_n_−1 \+ F_n_−2, where F1 = 1 and F2 = 1.

Hence the first 12 terms will be:

> F1 = 1  
>  F2 = 1  
>  F3 = 2  
>  F4 = 3  
>  F5 = 5  
>  F6 = 8  
>  F7 = 13  
>  F8 = 21  
>  F9 = 34  
>  F10 = 55  
>  F11 = 89  
>  F12 = 144

The 12th term, F12, is the first term to contain three digits.

What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000
digits?
