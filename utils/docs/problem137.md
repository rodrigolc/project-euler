Difficulty rating: 50%

Consider the infinite polynomial series AF(_x_) = _x_F1 \+ _x_2F2 \+ _x_3F3 \+
..., where F_k_ is the _k_th term in the Fibonacci sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,
... ; that is, F_k_ = F_k_−1 \+ F_k_−2, F1 = 1 and F2 = 1.

For this problem we shall be interested in values of _x_ for which AF(_x_) is
a positive integer.

Surprisingly AF(1/2) |  =  | (1/2).1 + (1/2)2.1 + (1/2)3.2 + (1/2)4.3 +
(1/2)5.5 + ...  
---|---|---  
  |  =  | 1/2 + 1/4 + 2/8 + 3/16 + 5/32 + ...  
  |  =  | 2  
  
The corresponding values of _x_ for the first five natural numbers are shown
below.

**_x_**| **AF(_x_)**  
---|---  
√2−1| 1  
1/2| 2  
(√13−2)/3| 3  
(√89−5)/8| 4  
(√34−3)/5| 5  
  
We shall call AF(_x_) a golden nugget if _x_ is rational, because they become
increasingly rarer; for example, the 10th golden nugget is 74049690.

Find the 15th golden nugget.
