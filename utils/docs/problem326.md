Let an be a sequence recursively defined by:
![p326_formula1.gif](project/images/p326_formula1.gif).

So the first 10 elements of an are: 1,1,0,3,0,3,5,4,1,9.

Let f(N,M) represent the number of pairs (p,q) such that:

![p326_formula2.gif](project/images/p326_formula2.gif)

It can be seen that f(10,10)=4 with the pairs (3,3), (5,5), (7,9) and (9,10).

You are also given that f(104,103)=97158.

Find f(1012,106).
