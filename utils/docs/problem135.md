Given the positive integers, _x_, _y_, and _z_, are consecutive terms of an
arithmetic progression, the least value of the positive integer, _n_, for
which the equation, _x_2 − _y_2 − _z_2 = _n_, has exactly two solutions is _n_
= 27:

342 − 272 − 202 = 122 − 92 − 62 = 27

It turns out that _n_ = 1155 is the least value which has exactly ten
solutions.

How many values of _n_ less than one million have exactly ten distinct
solutions?
