In the 5 by 5 matrix below, the minimal path sum from the top left to the
bottom right, by **only moving to the right and down**, is indicated in bold
red and is equal to 2427.

$$ \begin{pmatrix} \color{red}{131} &amp; 673 &amp; 234 &amp; 103 &amp; 18\\\
\color{red}{201} &amp; \color{red}{96} &amp; \color{red}{342} &amp; 965 &amp;
150\\\ 630 &amp; 803 &amp; \color{red}{746} &amp; \color{red}{422} &amp;
111\\\ 537 &amp; 699 &amp; 497 &amp; \color{red}{121} &amp; 956\\\ 805 &amp;
732 &amp; 524 &amp; \color{red}{37} &amp; \color{red}{331} \end{pmatrix} $$

(right click and "Save Link/Target As..."), a 31K text file containing a 80 by
80 matrix, from the top left to the bottom right by only moving right and
down.
