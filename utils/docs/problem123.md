Let _p_n be the _n_th prime: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ..., and let _r_ be the remainder
when (_p_n−1)_n_ \+ (_p_n+1)_n_ is divided by _p_n2.

For example, when _n_ = 3, _p_3 = 5, and 43 \+ 63 = 280 ≡ 5 mod 25.

The least value of _n_ for which the remainder first exceeds 109 is 7037.

Find the least value of _n_ for which the remainder first exceeds 1010.
