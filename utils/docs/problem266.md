The divisors of 12 are: 1,2,3,4,6 and 12.  
The largest divisor of 12 that does not exceed the square root of 12 is 3.  
We shall call the largest divisor of an integer n that does not exceed the
square root of n the pseudo square root (PSR) of n.  
It can be seen that PSR(3102)=47.

Let p be the product of the primes below 190.  
Find PSR(p) mod 1016.
