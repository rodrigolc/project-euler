Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula, Pn=n(3n−1)/2. The first ten
pentagonal numbers are:

1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145, ...

It can be seen that P4 \+ P7 = 22 + 70 = 92 = P8. However, their difference,
70 − 22 = 48, is not pentagonal.

Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, Pj and Pk, for which their sum and
difference are pentagonal and D = |Pk − Pj| is minimised; what is the value of
D?
