An integer is called _eleven-free_ if its decimal expansion does not contain
any substring representing a power of 11 except 1.

For example, 2404 and 13431 are eleven-free, while 911 and 4121331 are not.

Let E(_n_) be the _n_th positive eleven-free integer. For example, E(3) = 3,
E(200) = 213 and E(500Â 000) = 531563.

Find E(1018).
