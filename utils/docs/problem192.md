Let x be a real number.  
A _best approximation_ to x for the _denominator bound_ d is a rational number
r/s _in reduced form_, with s ≤ d, such that any rational number which is
closer to x than r/s has a denominator larger than d:

|p/q-x| &lt; |r/s-x| ⇒ q &gt; d

For example, the best approximation to √13 for the denominator bound 20 is
18/5 and the best approximation to √13 for the denominator bound 30 is 101/28.

Find the sum of all denominators of the best approximations to √n for the
denominator bound 1012, where n is not a perfect square and 1 &lt; n ≤ 100000.
