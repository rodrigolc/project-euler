Consider an equilateral triangle in which straight lines are drawn from each
vertex to the middle of the opposite side, such as in the _size 1_ triangle in
the sketch below.

Sixteen triangles of either different shape or size or orientation or location
can now be observed in that triangle. Using _size 1_ triangles as building
blocks, larger triangles can be formed, such as the _size 2_ triangle in the
above sketch. One-hundred and four triangles of either different shape or size
or orientation or location can now be observed in that _size 2_ triangle.

It can be observed that the _size 2_ triangle contains 4 _size 1_ triangle
building blocks. A _size 3_ triangle would contain 9 _size 1_ triangle
building blocks and a _size n_ triangle would thus contain _n2 size 1_
triangle building blocks.

If we denote T(n) as the number of triangles present in a triangle of _size
n_, then

T(1) = 16  
T(2) = 104

Find T(36).
