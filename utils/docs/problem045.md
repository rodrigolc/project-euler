Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following
formulae:

Triangle |   | T_n_=_n_(_n_+1)/2 |   | 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...  
---|---|---|---|---  
Pentagonal |   | P_n_=_n_(3_n_−1)/2 |   | 1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ...  
Hexagonal |   | H_n_=_n_(2_n_−1) |   | 1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ...  
  
It can be verified that T285 = P165 = H143 = 40755.

Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.
