In the following equation x, y, and n are positive integers.

1  
x

|  \+  |

1  
y

|  =  |

1  
n  
  
---|---|---|---|---  
  
For n = 4 there are exactly three distinct solutions:

1  
5

|  \+  |

1  
20

|  =  |

1  
4  
  
---|---|---|---|---  
  
1  
6

|  \+  |

1  
12

|  =  |

1  
4  
  
1  
8

|  \+  |

1  
8

|  =  |

1  
4  
  
What is the least value of n for which the number of distinct solutions
exceeds one-thousand?

NOTE: This problem is an easier version of [Problem 110](problem=110); it is
strongly advised that you solve this one first.
