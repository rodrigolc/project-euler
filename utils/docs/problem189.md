Consider the following configuration of 64 triangles:

![](project/images/p189_grid.gif)

We wish to colour the interior of each triangle with one of three colours:
red, green or blue, so that no two neighbouring triangles have the same
colour. Such a colouring shall be called valid. Here, two triangles are said
to be neighbouring if they share an edge.  
Note: if they only share a vertex, then they are not neighbours.

For example, here is a valid colouring of the above grid:

A colouring C' which is obtained from a colouring C by rotation or reflection
is considered _distinct_ from C unless the two are identical.

How many distinct valid colourings are there for the above configuration?
