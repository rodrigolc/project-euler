Difficulty rating: 40%

In the following equation x, y, and n are positive integers.

1  
x

|  \+  |

1  
y

|  =  |

1  
n  
  
---|---|---|---|---  
  
It can be verified that when n = 1260 there are 113 distinct solutions and
this is the least value of n for which the total number of distinct solutions
exceeds one hundred.

What is the least value of n for which the number of distinct solutions
exceeds four million?

NOTE: This problem is a much more difficult version of [Problem
108](problem=108) and as it is well beyond the limitations of a brute force
approach it requires a clever implementation.
