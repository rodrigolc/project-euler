Let Sn be the regular n-sided polygon – or _shape_ – whose vertices vk (k =
1,2,…,n) have coordinates:

| xk   =   cos( 2k-1/n ×180° )  
---|---  
| yk   =   sin( 2k-1/n ×180° )  
  
Each Sn is to be interpreted as a filled shape consisting of all points on the
perimeter and in the interior.

The _Minkowski sum_, S+T, of two shapes S and T is the result of adding every
point in S to every point in T, where point addition is performed coordinate-
wise: (u, v) + (x, y) = (u+x, v+y).

For example, the sum of S3 and S4 is the six-sided shape shown in pink below:

How many sides does S1864 + S1865 + … + S1909 have?
