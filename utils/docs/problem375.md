Let Sn be an integer sequence produced with the following pseudo-random number
generator:

S0 | =  | 290797  
---|---|---  
Sn+1 | =  | Sn2 mod 50515093  
  
Let A(i, j) be the minimum of the numbers Si, Si+1, ... , Sj for i ≤ j.  
Let M(N) = ΣA(i, j) for 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ N.  
We can verify that M(10) = 432256955 and M(10 000) = 3264567774119.

Find M(2 000 000 000).
