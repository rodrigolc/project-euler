An irrational decimal fraction is created by concatenating the positive
integers:

0.123456789101112131415161718192021...

It can be seen that the 12th digit of the fractional part is 1.

If _d__n_ represents the _n_th digit of the fractional part, find the value of
the following expression.

_d_1 × _d_10 × _d_100 × _d_1000 × _d_10000 × _d_100000 × _d_1000000
