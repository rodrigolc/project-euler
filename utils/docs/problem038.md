Take the number 192 and multiply it by each of 1, 2, and 3:

> 192 × 1 = 192  
>  192 × 2 = 384  
>  192 × 3 = 576

By concatenating each product we get the 1 to 9 pandigital, 192384576. We will
call 192384576 the concatenated product of 192 and (1,2,3)

The same can be achieved by starting with 9 and multiplying by 1, 2, 3, 4, and
5, giving the pandigital, 918273645, which is the concatenated product of 9
and (1,2,3,4,5).

What is the largest 1 to 9 pandigital 9-digit number that can be formed as the
concatenated product of an integer with (1,2, ... , n) where n &gt; 1?
