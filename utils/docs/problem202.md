Difficulty rating: 60%

Three mirrors are arranged in the shape of an equilateral triangle, with their
reflective surfaces pointing inwards. There is an infinitesimal gap at each
vertex of the triangle through which a laser beam may pass.

Label the vertices A, B and C. There are 2 ways in which a laser beam may
enter vertex C, bounce off 11 surfaces, then exit through the same vertex: one
way is shown below; the other is the reverse of that.

There are 80840 ways in which a laser beam may enter vertex C, bounce off
1000001 surfaces, then exit through the same vertex.

In how many ways can a laser beam enter at vertex C, bounce off 12017639147
surfaces, then exit through the same vertex?
