For an integer M, we define R(M) as the sum of 1/(p·q) for all the integer
pairs p and q which satisfy all of these conditions:

  * 1 ≤ p &lt; q ≤ M
  * p \+ q ≥ M
  * p and q are coprime.

We also define S(N) as the sum of R(i) for 2 ≤ i ≤ N.  
We can verify that S(2) = R(2) = 1/2, S(10) ≈ 6.9147 and S(100) ≈ 58.2962.

Find S(107). Give your answer rounded to four decimal places.
