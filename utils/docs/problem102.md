Difficulty rating: 15%

Three distinct points are plotted at random on a Cartesian plane, for which
-1000 ≤ _x_, _y_ ≤ 1000, such that a triangle is formed.

Consider the following two triangles:

A(-340,495), B(-153,-910), C(835,-947)  
  
X(-175,41), Y(-421,-714), Z(574,-645)

It can be verified that triangle ABC contains the origin, whereas triangle XYZ
does not.

Using [triangles.txt](project/resources/p102_triangles.txt) (right click and
'Save Link/Target As...'), a 27K text file containing the co-ordinates of one
thousand "random" triangles, find the number of triangles for which the
interior contains the origin.

NOTE: The first two examples in the file represent the triangles in the
example given above.
