There are 1111 ways in which five 6-sided dice (sides numbered 1 to 6) can be
rolled so that the top three sum to 15. Some examples are:  
  
D1,D2,D3,D4,D5 = 4,3,6,3,5  
D1,D2,D3,D4,D5 = 4,3,3,5,6  
D1,D2,D3,D4,D5 = 3,3,3,6,6  
D1,D2,D3,D4,D5 = 6,6,3,3,3  
  
In how many ways can twenty 12-sided dice (sides numbered 1 to 12) be rolled
so that the top ten sum to 70?
