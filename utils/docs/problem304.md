For any positive integer n the function next_prime(n) returns the smallest
prime p  
such that p&gt;n.

The sequence a(n) is defined by:  
a(1)=next_prime(1014) and a(n)=next_prime(a(n-1)) for n&gt;1\.

The fibonacci sequence f(n) is defined by: f(0)=0, f(1)=1 and
f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2) for n&gt;1\.

The sequence b(n) is defined as f(a(n)).

Find ∑b(n) for 1≤n≤100 000. Give your answer mod 1234567891011.
