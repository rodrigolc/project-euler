Let C be the circle with radius r, x2 \+ y2 = r2. We choose two points P(a, b)
and Q(-a, c) so that the line passing through P and Q is tangent to C.

For example, the quadruplet (r, a, b, c) = (2, 6, 2, -7) satisfies this
property.

Let F(R, X) be the number of the integer quadruplets (r, a, b, c) with this
property, and with 0 &lt; r ≤ R and 0 &lt; a ≤ X.

We can verify that F(1, 5) = 10, F(2, 10) = 52 and F(10, 100) = 3384.  
Find F(108, 109) + F(109, 108).
