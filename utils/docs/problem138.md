Consider the isosceles triangle with base length, _b_ = 16, and legs, L = 17.

By using the Pythagorean theorem it can be seen that the height of the
triangle, _h_ = √(172 − 82) = 15, which is one less than the base length.

With _b_ = 272 and L = 305, we get _h_ = 273, which is one more than the base
length, and this is the second smallest isosceles triangle with the property
that _h_ = _b_ ± 1.

Find ∑ L for the twelve smallest isosceles triangles for which _h_ = _b_ ± 1
and _b_, L are positive integers.
