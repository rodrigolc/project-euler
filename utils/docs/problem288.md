For any prime p the number N(p,q) is defined by N(p,q) = âˆ‘n=0 to q Tn*pn  
with Tn generated by the following random number generator:

S0 = 290797  
Sn+1 = Sn2 mod 50515093  
Tn = Sn mod p

Let Nfac(p,q) be the factorial of N(p,q).  
Let NF(p,q) be the number of factors p in Nfac(p,q).

You are given that NF(3,10000) mod 320=624955285.

Find NF(61,107) mod 6110
