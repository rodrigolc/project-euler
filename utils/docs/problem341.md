The **Golomb's self-describing sequence** {G(n)} is the only nondecreasing
sequence of natural numbers such that n appears exactly G(n) times in the
sequence. The values of G(n) for the first few n are

n| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8| 9| 10| 11| 12| 13| 14| 15| …  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
G(n)| 1| 2| 2| 3| 3| 4| 4| 4| 5| 5| 5| 6| 6| 6| 6| …  
  
You are given that G(103) = 86, G(106) = 6137.  
You are also given that ΣG(n3) = 153506976 for 1 ≤ n &lt; 103.

Find ΣG(n3) for 1 ≤ n &lt; 106.
