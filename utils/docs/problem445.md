For every integer n&gt;1, the family of functions fn,a,b is defined by
fn,a,b(x)≡ax+b mod n for a,b,x integer and 0&lt;a&lt;n, 0≤b&lt;n, 0≤x&lt;n.  
We will call fn,a,b a _retraction_ if fn,a,b(fn,a,b(x))≡fn,a,b(x) mod n for
every 0≤x&lt;n.  
Let R(n) be the number of retractions for n.

You are given that  
∑ R(c) for c=C(100 000,k), and 1 ≤ k ≤99 999 ≡628701600 (mod 1 000 000 007).  
(C(n,k) is the binomial coefficient).  

Find ∑ R(c) for c=C(10 000 000,k), and 1 ≤k≤ 9 999 999.  
Give your answer modulo 1 000 000 007.
