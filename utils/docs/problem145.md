Some positive integers _n_ have the property that the sum [ _n_ \+
reverse(_n_) ] consists entirely of odd (decimal) digits. For instance, 36 +
63 = 99 and 409 + 904 = 1313. We will call such numbers _reversible_; so 36,
63, 409, and 904 are reversible. Leading zeroes are not allowed in either _n_
or reverse(_n_).

There are 120 reversible numbers below one-thousand.

How many reversible numbers are there below one-billion (109)?
