Let us define a _geometric triangle_ as an integer sided triangle with sides a
≤ b ≤ c so that its sides form a **geometric progression**, i.e. b2 = a · c .

An example of such a geometric triangle is the triangle with sides a = 144, b
= 156 and c = 169.

There are 861805 geometric triangles with perimeter ≤ 106 .

How many geometric triangles exist with perimeter ≤ 2.5·1013 ?
