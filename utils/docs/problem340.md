For fixed integers a, b, c, define the _crazy function_ F(n) as follows:  
F(n) = n \- c for all n &gt; b  
F(n) = F(a + F(a + F(a + F(a + n)))) for all n â‰¤ b.

Also, define S(a, b, c) =
![p340_formula.gif](project/images/p340_formula.gif).

For example, if a = 50, b = 2000 and c = 40, then F(0) = 3240 and F(2000) =
2040.  
Also, S(50, 2000, 40) = 5204240.

Find the last 9 digits of S(217, 721, 127).
