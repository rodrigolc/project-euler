It is easily proved that no equilateral triangle exists with integral length
sides and integral area. However, the _almost equilateral triangle_ 5-5-6 has
an area of 12 square units.

We shall define an _almost equilateral triangle_ to be a triangle for which
two sides are equal and the third differs by no more than one unit.

Find the sum of the perimeters of all _almost equilateral triangles_ with
integral side lengths and area and whose perimeters do not exceed one billion
(1,000,000,000).
