For an n-tuple of integers t = (a1, ..., an), let (x1, ..., xn) be the
solutions of the polynomial equation xn \+ a1xn-1 \+ a2xn-2 \+ ... + an-1x \+
an = 0.

Consider the following two conditions:

  * x1, ..., xn are all real. 
  * If x1, ..., xn are sorted, ⌊xi⌋ = i for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. (⌊·⌋: floor function.) 

In the case of n = 4, there are 12 n-tuples of integers which satisfy both
conditions.  
We define S(t) as the sum of the absolute values of the integers in t.  
For n = 4 we can verify that ∑S(t) = 2087 for all n-tuples t which satisfy
both conditions.

Find ∑S(t) for n = 7.
