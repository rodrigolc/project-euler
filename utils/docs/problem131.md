## Prime cube partnership

### Problem 131 ![](images/icon_info.png)Published on Friday, 10th November

Difficulty rating: 40%

There are some prime values, _p_, for which there exists a positive integer,
_n_, such that the expression _n_3 \+ _n_2_p_ is a perfect cube.

For example, when _p_ = 19, 83 \+ 82Ã—19 = 123.

What is perhaps most surprising is that for each prime with this property the
value of _n_ is unique, and there are only four such primes below one-hundred.

How many primes below one million have this remarkable property?
