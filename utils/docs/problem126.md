The minimum number of cubes to cover every visible face on a cuboid measuring
3 x 2 x 1 is twenty-two.

If we then add a second layer to this solid it would require forty-six cubes
to cover every visible face, the third layer would require seventy-eight
cubes, and the fourth layer would require one-hundred and eighteen cubes to
cover every visible face.

However, the first layer on a cuboid measuring 5 x 1 x 1 also requires twenty-
two cubes; similarly the first layer on cuboids measuring 5 x 3 x 1, 7 x 2 x
1, and 11 x 1 x 1 all contain forty-six cubes.

We shall define C(_n_) to represent the number of cuboids that contain _n_
cubes in one of its layers. So C(22) = 2, C(46) = 4, C(78) = 5, and C(118) =
8.

It turns out that 154 is the least value of _n_ for which C(_n_) = 10.

Find the least value of _n_ for which C(_n_) = 1000.
