The points P (_x_1, _y_1) and Q (_x_2, _y_2) are plotted at integer co-
ordinates and are joined to the origin, O(0,0), to form ΔOPQ.

There are exactly fourteen triangles containing a right angle that can be
formed when each co-ordinate lies between 0 and 2 inclusive; that is,  
0 ≤ _x_1, _y_1, _x_2, _y_2 ≤ 2.

Given that 0 ≤ _x_1, _y_1, _x_2, _y_2 ≤ 50, how many right triangles can be
formed?
