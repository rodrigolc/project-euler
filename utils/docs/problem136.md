Difficulty rating: 50%

The positive integers, _x_, _y_, and _z_, are consecutive terms of an
arithmetic progression. Given that _n_ is a positive integer, the equation,
_x_2 − _y_2 − _z_2 = _n_, has exactly one solution when _n_ = 20:

132 − 102 − 72 = 20

In fact there are twenty-five values of _n_ below one hundred for which the
equation has a unique solution.

How many values of _n_ less than fifty million have exactly one solution?
