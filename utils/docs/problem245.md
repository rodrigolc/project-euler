Difficulty rating: 80%

We shall call a fraction that cannot be cancelled down a resilient fraction.  
Furthermore we shall define the resilience of a denominator, R(d), to be the
ratio of its proper fractions that are resilient; for example, R(12) = 4⁄11.

The resilience of a number d &gt; 1 is then |

φ(d)  
d − 1

| , where φ is Euler's totient function.  
---|---|---  
We further define the **coresilience** of a number n &gt; 1 as C(n)| =  |

n − φ(n)  
n − 1

| .  
---|---|---|---  
The coresilience of a prime p is C(p) | =  |

1  
p − 1

| .  
---|---|---|---  
  
Find the sum of all **composite** integers 1 &lt; n ≤ 2×1011, for which C(n)
is a unit fraction.
