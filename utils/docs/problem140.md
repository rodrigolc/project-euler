Consider the infinite polynomial series AG(_x_) = _x_G1 \+ _x_2G2 \+ _x_3G3 \+
..., where G_k_ is the _k_th term of the second order recurrence relation G_k_
= G_k_−1 \+ G_k_−2, G1 = 1 and G2 = 4; that is, 1, 4, 5, 9, 14, 23, ... .

For this problem we shall be concerned with values of _x_ for which AG(_x_) is
a positive integer.

The corresponding values of _x_ for the first five natural numbers are shown
below.

**_x_**| **AG(_x_)**  
---|---  
(√5−1)/4| 1  
2/5| 2  
(√22−2)/6| 3  
(√137−5)/14| 4  
1/2| 5  
  
We shall call AG(_x_) a golden nugget if _x_ is rational, because they become
increasingly rarer; for example, the 20th golden nugget is 211345365.

Find the sum of the first thirty golden nuggets.
