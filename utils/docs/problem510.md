Circles A and B are tangent to each other and to line L at three distinct
points.  
Circle C is inside the space between A, B and L, and tangent to all three.  
Let rA, rB and rC be the radii of A, B and C respectively.

Let S(n) = Σ rA + rB + rC, for 0 &lt; rA ≤ rB ≤ n where rA, rB and rC are
integers. The only solution for 0 &lt; rA ≤ rB ≤ 5 is rA = 4, rB = 4 and rC =
1, so S(5) = 4 + 4 + 1 = 9. You are also given S(100) = 3072.

Find S(109).
