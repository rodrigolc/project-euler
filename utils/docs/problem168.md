Difficulty rating: 65%

Consider the number 142857. We can right-rotate this number by moving the last
digit (7) to the front of it, giving us 714285.  
It can be verified that 714285=5Ã—142857.  
This demonstrates an unusual property of 142857: it is a divisor of its right-
rotation.

Find the last 5 digits of the sum of all integers n, 10 &lt; n &lt; 10100,
that have this property.
