A **spherical triangle** is a figure formed on the surface of a sphere by
three **great circular arcs** intersecting pairwise in three vertices.

Let C(r) be the sphere with the centre (0,0,0) and radius r.  
Let Z(r) be the set of points on the surface of C(r) with integer coordinates.  
Let T(r) be the set of spherical triangles with vertices in Z(r). Degenerate
spherical triangles, formed by three points on the same great arc, are _not_
included in T(r).  
Let A(r) be the area of the smallest spherical triangle in T(r).

For example A(14) is 3.294040 rounded to six decimal places.

Find ![p332_sum.gif](project/images/p332_sum.gif) A(r). Give your answer
rounded to six decimal places.
