Consider the consecutive primes _p_1 = 19 and _p_2 = 23. It can be verified
that 1219 is the smallest number such that the last digits are formed by _p_1
whilst also being divisible by _p_2.

In fact, with the exception of _p_1 = 3 and _p_2 = 5, for every pair of
consecutive primes, _p_2 &gt; _p_1, there exist values of _n_ for which the
last digits are formed by _p_1 and _n_ is divisible by _p_2. Let _S_ be the
smallest of these values of _n_.

Find ∑ _S_ for every pair of consecutive primes with 5 ≤ _p_1 ≤ 1000000.
